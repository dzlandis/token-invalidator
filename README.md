### Where did you find my token?
It was on a public website available for anyone to see.

I have **INVALIDATED** it by posting it here! When Discord tokens are posted to Github, Discord automatically **INVALIDATES** the token and sends you a notification!

### Did you hack into my account?
I did not.

### Why did you "steal" my token?
I did not. I helped you by making it **INVALID**! Your token was found on a publicly accessible website where **ANYONE** could have found it! By **INVALIDATING** your token, I have prevented it from being used in raids, scams, and other malicious intents.

### How did you get so many tokens?
I keep that private as to not guide malicious people into doing the same.
