### How'd I get scammed!
If you'd like to know more about how you may have been scammed (giving the attacker access to your token) and educate yourself to prevent this from happening again, I'd highly recommend checking out [No Text To Speech](https://www.youtube.com/c/NoTextToSpeech) as he posts great resources on how to prevent getting scammed!

### Where did you find my token?
It was on a public website available for anyone to see.

### What did you do to my token?
I have **INVALIDATED** it by posting it here! When Discord tokens are posted to Github, Discord automatically **INVALIDATES** the token and sends you a notification!

### Did you hack into my account?
No! I actually prevented your account from being abused by other attackers who could have accessed it.

### Why did you "steal" my token?
I did not. I helped you by making it **INVALID**! Your token was found on a publicly accessible website where **ANYONE** could have found it! By **INVALIDATING** your token, I have prevented it from being used in raids, scams, and other malicious intents.

### How did you get so many tokens?
I keep that private as to not guide malicious people into doing the same.

### Got more questions?
